<h1> Multifunctor means more than it's a functor in each argument.</h1>
<p>
    Let \( C \) and \( D \) be a categories.   A bifunctor from \(C\) to \(D\)
    is defined as a functor from the product category:  \( F : C \times C \to D
    \). Multifunctors are the obvious generalization.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, this implies that for any fixed object \(X\),
    \(F(X,-)\) and \(F(-,X)\) are functors.   But that is not sufficient
    to define a bifunctor. Let \(f : A \to B \) and \(g : A' \to B' \)
    be functors in \(C\).   The following diagram commutes in \(C \times C\),
    because morphisms in the product category are defined as paris of morphisms.
</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{CD}
(A,A') @>{1 \times g}>> (A,B')\\
@V{f \times 1}VV @V{f \times 1}VV \\
(B,A') @>{1 \times g}>> (B,B')
\end{CD}
$$
</div>

<p>So the image must commute in \(D\)</p>

<div>
$$
\begin{CD}
F(A,A') @>{F(1 \times g)}>> F(A,B')\\
@V{F(f \times 1)}VV @V{F(f \times 1)}VV \\
F(B,A') @>{F(1 \times g)}>> F(B,B')
\end{CD}
$$
</div>

$$ \newcommand{\catname}[1]{\text{#1}} $$

But it's not sufficient that \(F\) be a functor in each argument to guarantee
that this will be the case.

<p> Here is a counterexample.   Let \(C\) be any
nonabelian group \(G\), so \(C\) has one object and the morphisms are the
group elements.<br>
Let \(D = \catname{Set}\) <br>
Let \( F(\cdot,\cdot) = G \) <br>
For \(f,g \in G\) let \(F(f,g) : G \to G\) take \(x \mapsto fgx \)
</p>

For the image diagram above to commute, that would mean that for any \(f,g \in G\)
we would have \( fg = gf \)
